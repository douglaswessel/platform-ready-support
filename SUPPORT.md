## FAQ
**How do I plan attempts?**  
Choose Conservative, Standard, or Aggressive in “Attempt Planning.” You can edit any number manually.

**How are warm-ups calculated?**  
Based on your opener and selected density (Less / Standard / More). Edit steps anytime.

**What is DOTS?**  
DOTS is a scoring formula using bodyweight and total to compare performance across classes.

## Troubleshooting
- **No attempts showing?** Enter e1RM values for S/B/D on the Meet screen and tap *Generate Plan*.
- **Wrong units?** Change Units in Settings; the app will re-round to legal increments.
- **App crashed?** Reopen and data will autosave; please attach steps + screenshots in an issue.
